# Safe and Robust Smart Intersection Control under Sensing Uncertainty and Abnormal Requests

A CPS course project implementing and evaluating adaptive traffic signal control with a runtime safety shield, tested under uncertainty and stress conditions using SUMO simulation and PRISM formal verification.

## Project Overview

This project investigates whether a **safety shield layer** on top of an adaptive signal controller can preserve basic safety properties and improve robustness under sensing uncertainty, without unacceptable efficiency degradation. We compare four controllers across seven scenarios (including demand-only and uncertainty-injected conditions), using both simulation-based evaluation (7 × 4 × 20 = 560 runs) and probabilistic model checking.

The intersection is a **single four-way junction** with 8 signal phases (4 service + 4 clearance), supporting both vehicles and pedestrians.

### Controllers

| ID | Controller | Description |
|----|-----------|-------------|
| B1 | **Fixed-Time** | Static 8-phase cycle (102s period) with fixed durations |
| B2 | **Actuated** | Demand-responsive: switches after min green when competing demand exists |
| A1 | **Adaptive-Only** | Score-based phase selection weighing queue size, starvation, and switch cost |
| A2 | **Adaptive+Shield** | A1 + three-layer safety filter (min-hold guard, score-margin filter, starvation override) |

### Scenarios (S1–S7)

| ID | Scenario | Base Demand | Runtime Uncertainty |
|----|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| S1 | Balanced | Medium symmetric | None |
| S2 | Directional Surge | NS heavy (~75 veh), EW low (~20 veh) | None |
| S3 | Ped Heavy | Medium vehicles, ~2.5× pedestrians | None |
| S4 | Delay Detection | Balanced base | 5s fixed sensing delay on all lanes |
| S5 | False Ped + Burst | Bursty peds base | Phantom ped requests (20% false rate) |
| S6 | Detector Failure | Balanced base | NS vehicle detectors stuck-off (t=60–180s) |
| S7 | Combined Stress | NS surge base | Delay (5s) + false ped (20%) simultaneously |

S1–S3 test demand-profile stress without uncertainty. S4–S6 each inject one type of sensing anomaly. S7 combines directional surge with two uncertainty sources. All scenarios use the same network and 8-phase structure.

## Experiment Protocol

- **Formal matrix:** 7 scenarios × 4 controllers × 20 seeds = **560 runs**
- **Duration:** 300 simulated seconds per run
- **Seed mechanism:** passed to SUMO via `--seed`; affects vehicle/pedestrian departure jitter
- **Uncertainty injection:** S4–S7 must be run via `--scenario_id` (not `--cfg` alone), which loads the scenario YAML and activates the corresponding runtime injection layer
- **S1–S3** can be run via either `--cfg` or `--scenario_id`; both produce the same results since no runtime uncertainty is enabled

## Tech Stack

- **SUMO 1.26** — microscopic traffic simulation
- **Python 3 + TraCI** — controller logic, experiment orchestration, analysis
- **PRISM 4.10** — probabilistic model checking (requires `E:\prism-4.10\lib` on system PATH)
- **matplotlib** — result visualization

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- SUMO 1.26+ (with `sumo`, `sumo-gui`, `netconvert` on PATH; TraCI bundled)
- PRISM 4.10 (optional; requires `E:\prism-4.10\lib` added to system PATH for DLL resolution)

Install Python dependencies:
```bash
pip install pyyaml matplotlib
```

TraCI ships with SUMO. Add SUMO's tools directory to `PYTHONPATH`:
```bash
export PYTHONPATH="$SUMO_HOME/tools:$PYTHONPATH"
```

### Run a Single Experiment

```bash
# Basic: controller + base config (no uncertainty injection)
python scripts/run_experiment.py --controller adaptive_shield --cfg intersection_balanced --duration 300

# With scenario YAML (required for S4–S7 to enable uncertainty injection)
python scripts/run_experiment.py --controller adaptive_shield --scenario_id S4_delay_detection --duration 300 --seed 0

# With GUI for visual observation
python scripts/run_experiment.py --controller adaptive_shield --cfg intersection_balanced --duration 300 --gui
```

### Run Full Proposal Matrix (560 experiments)

```bash
python scripts/run_multiseed_proposal_matrix.py
```

Outputs:
- `results/proposal_multiseed_raw.csv` — 560 rows, one per (scenario, controller, seed)
- `results/proposal_multiseed_summary.csv` — 28 rows, mean±std per (scenario, controller)
- `results/proposal_matrix_main_table.csv` — formatted for direct reading

### Generate Final Charts

```bash
python scripts/analyze_proposal_matrix.py
```

Outputs 12 grouped bar charts (with error bars) and summary tables to `results/analysis_proposal_matrix/`.

### Run PRISM Formal Verification

```bash
# Base: 3 safety properties (no-conflict, no ped-vehicle overlap, clearance completion)
python scripts/run_prism_base.py

# Extended: 14 properties across normal and delayed configurations
python scripts/run_prism_extended.py
```

### Build Shield Evidence Cases

```bash
python scripts/build_case_studies.py
```

Generates 3 case study packages in `cases/`, each with step log, key events CSV, timeline PNG, and explanatory README.

## Key Results

### Formal Verification (PRISM)

**Base model** (DTMC, 448 states, 8-phase + demand abstraction):

| Property | Result |
|----------|--------|
| No conflict release: `P>=1 [G !"conflict"]` | **true** |
| No vehicle-pedestrian overlap: `P>=1 [G !"veh_conflict_during_ped"]` | **true** |
| Clearance always completes: `"clearance" => F cl_count=3` | **true** |

**Extended model** (adds wait-risk buckets + delay mode, 14 properties):

| Property | Normal | Delayed |
|----------|--------|---------|
| No-conflict invariant | true | true |
| Eventual service (Vehicle_NS) | P=1.0 | P=1.0 |
| Eventual service (Ped_EW) | P=1.0 | P=1.0 |
| Steady-state Vehicle_NS green fraction | 14.7% | 16.0% |
| Steady-state Ped_EW green fraction | 12.3% | 13.8% |
| Steady-state extreme wait (any direction) | 23.0% | 23.1% |

The extended model covers representative service/risk properties for one vehicle direction (NS) and one pedestrian direction (EW) under normal vs. delayed observation. It abstracts delay_detection as a binary mode; false_ped and detector_failure are evaluated in SUMO but not yet abstracted into separate PRISM modes.

### Simulation Results (20-seed mean, 300s)

Selected highlights from the full 7 × 4 matrix (see `results/proposal_multiseed_summary.csv` for complete data):

**S1 Balanced:** Adaptive-Only achieves the lowest vehicle queue (2.21±0.10) and vehicle wait (2.51±0.18s). Actuated achieves the lowest ped wait (2.17±0.15s). Shield records 1.15±0.37 dangerous switch attempts per run, all successfully intercepted.

**S2 Directional Surge:** Adaptive variants maintain avg queue ~3.5 vs Fixed-Time/Actuated >10, demonstrating score-based selection handles asymmetric demand well. Ped starvation reaches 5.0±1.4 for both adaptive controllers, reflecting the inherent trade-off under directional imbalance.

**S6 Detector Failure:** The most disruptive scenario for demand-dependent controllers. Adaptive-Only vehicle P95 wait jumps to 65.7±2.5s with vehicle starvation 3.1±0.4, compared to Actuated's 25.3±0.8s. This demonstrates vulnerability when demand observations become unreliable.

**S7 Combined Stress:** Under simultaneous NS surge + delay + false ped, Shield logs the highest dangerous_switch_attempt_count (3.7±1.4), confirming active safety filtering. Adaptive variants still outperform baselines on vehicle queue (~4.1 vs ~10.0).

**Overall pattern:** Adaptive+Shield does not uniformly dominate on raw efficiency metrics. Its value lies in maintaining safety invariants, reducing dangerous switch attempts, and providing more stable behavior under uncertainty — with moderate efficiency trade-off relative to Adaptive-Only.

## Metrics

The experiment framework tracks four categories of metrics, aligned with the proposal analysis structure:

**Safety Compliance:**
- `conflict_release_count` — conflicting phases simultaneously green (always 0 in current experiments, as expected by design)
- `dangerous_switch_attempt_count` — switch attempts violating min-green or safety constraints

**Service Guarantee:**
- `vehicle_wait_p95` / `ped_wait_p95` — 95th percentile waiting time
- `vehicle_starvation_count` / `ped_starvation_count` — events where vehicle wait >90s or ped wait >60s

**Efficiency:**
- `average_vehicle_queue_length` / `max_vehicle_queue_length`
- `average_vehicle_waiting_time` / `max_vehicle_waiting_time`
- `average_ped_waiting_time` / `max_ped_waiting_time`

**Stability:**
- `switch_rate_per_300s` — service phase transitions normalized to 300s
- `unnecessary_switch_rate` — switches where target phase had near-zero demand

Per-step CSV logs (36+ columns) are generated during each run and record candidate phase, final action, shield override events, observed vs. true demand, and uncertainty state. These are used by `build_case_studies.py` and are stored in `archive/step_logs/` (regenerable by re-running the experiment scripts).

## Architecture

### Uncertainty Injection Layer (`core/uncertainty.py`)

Runtime wrappers that modify what controllers observe, without changing real SUMO world state:
- **DelayBuffer**: returns demand observations from N steps ago (fixed delay)
- **FalsePedInjector**: injects phantom pedestrian demand via per-step Bernoulli trigger (seed-controlled)
- **DetectorFailure**: spoofs lane demand during configurable failure windows (modes: stuck-off, stuck-on, intermittent)

### Safety Shield (in `scripts/run_experiment.py`, `step_adaptive_shield`)

Three-layer filter between the adaptive scheduler's candidate and the executed action:
1. **Min-hold guard**: blocks switching before `SHIELD_MIN_HOLD` (18s) elapsed in current phase
2. **Score-margin filter**: rejects switches where candidate score leads by less than `SHIELD_SCORE_MARGIN` (1.0)
3. **Starvation override**: forces service for phases unserved for >`SHIELD_STARVATION_LIMIT` (40s), or with demand >= `SHIELD_DEMAND_OVERRIDE` (3)

When the shield blocks a switch, the controller holds the current phase. Clearance enforcement is handled structurally (service-to-service transitions always pass through clearance).

### Scenario Configuration (`configs/scenarios/*.yaml`)

Declarative YAML files specifying each scenario's demand profile, base SUMO config, and uncertainty parameters. The `scenario_loader` validates required fields, computes `can_run_base_mapping` and `pending_features`, and passes uncertainty settings to the runtime injection layer.

## Current Scope and Limitations

1. **Single intersection only.** The network is one four-way junction; multi-intersection coordination is out of scope.
2. **Adaptive+Shield is not universally best on efficiency.** In several scenarios (e.g., S1, S6), Actuated or Adaptive-Only achieve lower average wait or queue. The shield's value is in safety preservation and robustness under uncertainty, not raw throughput optimization.
3. **PRISM model is a representative abstraction.** The extended model covers one vehicle direction (NS) and one pedestrian direction (EW), with delay as the modeled uncertainty mode. False pedestrian requests and detector failure are evaluated in SUMO simulation but are not yet abstracted into separate PRISM configurations.
4. **Demand is flow-based, not origin-destination.** Routes use SUMO `<flow>` and `<personFlow>` elements; there is no turning-movement or OD matrix model.
5. **Seed affects departure jitter only.** The route files define deterministic flow rates; SUMO's `--seed` controls per-vehicle/pedestrian departure time jitter within those flows. Across 20 seeds, standard deviations are generally small.
6. **Case studies are evidence packages, not statistical tests.** The 3 shield cases demonstrate specific shield behaviors via step-log evidence. They complement but do not replace the 560-run statistical comparison.
7. **`conflict_release_count` is zero in all experiments.** The 8-phase design structurally prevents conflicting green states. This metric is included for completeness and formal alignment, not because violations were expected.
